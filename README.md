# AI Storyteller — Interactive Generative Narrative

A web-based interactive storytelling game that uses large language models (LLMs) to dynamically generate scenes, choices, and optionally images. This repo is a step-by-step build with clear iterations; the goal is to demonstrate multi-modal AI integration, stateful prompt design, rules engines, and full-stack engineering.

## Project Structure (high-level)
- `frontend/` — React app (Vite or Next.js)
- `backend/` — API server, story service, rules engine
- `docs/` — design docs, prompt experiments, sample outputs
- `.github/` — workflows & issue templates

## Getting started (Iteration 0)
This repository is at Iteration 0: planning and scaffolding. Next steps:
1. Scaffold frontend and backend (Iteration 1)
2. Implement AI story service with mocked LLM responses (Iteration 2)
3. Add persistent world-state and LLM integration (Iteration 3)
